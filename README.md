# Securing an ASP.NET Core app and web API using windows authentication

Repo shows how an web API and an ASP.NET Core Razor page application can be implemented to use windows authentication. The Razor page application uses Javascript to display an autocomplete control which gets the data indirectly from the service API which is protected using windows authentication. The Razor Page application uses the separate API to get the auto-complete suggestions data. Both applications are protected using windows authentication.
